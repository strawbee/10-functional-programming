## Overview

2. Refactor the forEach code in Article.loadAll().
3. Fix the code inside the <script> tags in each of the .html files.
4. Set constring in server.js.
5. Create a Handlebars template in admin.html.
6. Call the compile method on the template in articleView.js.
7. Complete Article.numWordsAll(), .allAuthors(), and .numWordsByAuthor() using the map and reduce methods.

## Architecture
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL.
Libraries: highlight.pack.js, marked.js, JQuery, Express, Postgres, Bodyparser, Handlebars, icoMoon, NodeJS.
